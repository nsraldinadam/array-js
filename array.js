Q1. What is an array in JavaScript?
is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable. It is an ordered collection of items, where each item can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Arrays are indexed, meaning each item has a numeric index starting from 0.

Q2. How do you create an array in JavaScript?
You can create an array in JavaScript using either the array literal syntax or the Array constructor. Here are two examples:

Using array literal syntax:
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', true];

Using the Array constructor:
let myArray = new Array(1, 2, 3, 'hello', true);
Q3. What data types can you store inside an array?
You can store any data type inside an array, including:
Create one array that mixes numbers, strings, and booleans.
 be created in various programming languages.
 Q4. What is the difference between an array and a single variable?
 A single variable holds is only one value in array     s can hold multiple values at once.

 Level 2: Accessing and Modifying Arrays 
 Q5. How do you access specific items from an array?
    You can access specific items from an array using their index. The index starts at 0 for the first item, 1 for the second item, and so on. You can use square brackets [] to access an item by its index.
    Write a program that prints the first and last elements of your array.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', true];
console.log(myArray[0]); // prints the first el
Q6. How do you change a value in an array?
    You can change a value in an array by accessing the item using its index and then assigning a new value to that index.
    Write a program that changes the second element of your array to a different value.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', true];
Q7. What does .length do?
    The .length property of an array returns the number of elements in the array. It is a read-only property that gives you the total count of items stored in the array.
    Write a program that prints the length of your array.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', true];
console.log(myArray.length); // prints the length of the array

Q8. How can you add a new element to the end of an array without using .push()?
Level 3: Working with Loops and Arrays
Q9. Write a program that prints all elements in an array using three different loops:
Here is a Python program that prints all elements in an array using three different loops: a for loop with an index, a for-each loop (or enhanced for loop), and a while loop.
Level 3: Working with Loops and Arrays

let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', true];
myArray[1] = 'world'; // changes the second element to 'world'
console.log(myArray); // prints the modified array
Q10. Write a program that prints all numbers in an array multiplied by 2 using a loop.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i] * 2);
}
Q11. Create an array of names and print each name in uppercase using a loop.
let names = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie'];
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i].toUpperCase());
}
Q12. Write a program that counts how many items are in an array without using .length. Use
a loop to count the items.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', true];
let count = 0;
for (let item of myArray) {
    count++;
}
console.log(count); // prints the number of items in the array
Q13. Create an array of numbers and use a loop to find the largest and smallest number.
let numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5];
let largest = numbers[0];
let smallest = numbers[0];

for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] > largest) {
        largest = numbers[i];
    }
    if (numbers[i] < smallest) {
        smallest = numbers[i];
    }
}
Q11. Create an array of names and print each name in uppercase using a loop.
let names = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie'];
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i].toUpperCase());

}

    }
    Q11. Create an array of names and print each name in uppercase using a loop.
    if (numbers[i] < smallest) {
        smallest = numbers[i];
    }

Use array index assignment instead.
}
console.log("Largest number is: " + largest);
console.log("Smallest number is: " + smallest);
Q8. How can you add a new element to the end of an array without using .push()?
You can add a new element to the end of an array by assigning a value to the index equal to the current length of the array. Here is an example:

let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray[myArray.length] = 4; adds 4 to the end of the array
console.log(myArray);  prints [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Q10. Write a program that prints all numbers in an array multiplied by 2 using a loop.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i] * 2);
}
Q11. Create an array of names and print each name in uppercase using a loop.
let names = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie'];
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i].toUpperCase());
    Q14. What do these array methods do?
    .pop() - removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
    .shift() - removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
    .unshift() - adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
    .slice() - returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
    .splice() - changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. It modifies the original array and returns an array containing the deleted elements, if any.
    .indexOf() - returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
    .includes() - determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.
    .join() - joins all elements of an array into a string and returns this string. You can specify a separator to be used between the elements in the resulting string.
    .reverse() - reverses the order of the elements in an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first.
Write code examples for each of the following:
● .push()
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4); 
console.log(myArray);  
● .pop()
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let lastElement = myArray.
console.log(lastElement); 
console.log(myArray); 
● .shift()
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let firstElement = myArray
console.log(firstElement); 
console.log(myArray); 
● .unshift()
let myArray = [2, 3, 4];
let newLength = myArray.unshift(1); 
console.log(newLength); 
console.log(myArray); 
Q15. How can you find the position of an item in an array?
You can find the position of an item in an array using the .indexOf() method. This method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. Here is an example:
Use .indexOf()
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
let position = myArray.indexOf('banana'); 
console.log(position);
.includes().
Q16. How can you check if an item exists in an array?
You can check if an item exists in an array using the .includes() method. This method returns true if the array contains the specified element, and false otherwise. Here is an example:
Try using .slice()
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
let exists = myArray.includes('banana'); 
console.log(exists);
Q17. How can you combine two arrays together?
You can combine two arrays together using the .concat() method or the spread operator (...). Here are examples of both methods:
Using .concat():
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = [4, 5, 6];
let combinedArray = array1.concat(array2);
console.log(combinedArray); 
Using the spread operator:
Q18. How can you check whether a variable is an array or not?

You can check whether a variable is an array or not using the Array.isArray() method. This method returns true if the variable is an array, and false otherwise. Here is an example:
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let notArray = 'hello';
console.log(Array.isArray(myArray)); 
console.log(Array.isArray(notArray));
Use .isArray() and explain when it’s useful.
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let notArray = 'hello';
console.log(Array.isArray(array1)); 
console.log(Array.isArray(notArray));
This method is useful when you want to ensure that a variable you are working with is indeed an array before performing array-specific operations on it. This can help prevent runtime errors and ensure that your code behaves as expected.
Q19. How can you reverse the order of items in an array?
You can reverse the order of items in an array using the .reverse() method. This method reverses the elements of the array in place, meaning it modifies the original array. Here is an example:
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
myArray.reverse(); 
console.log(myArray); 
This will output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Q20. How can you convert an array to a string?
You can convert an array to a string using the .join() method. This method joins all elements of the array into a single string, with an optional separator between each element. Here is an example:
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
let arrayAsString = myArray.join(', '); 
console.log(arrayAsString); 
This will output: "apple, banana, cherry"
If you don't provide a separator, the default is a comma:
let arrayAsStringDefault = myArray.join(); 
console.log(arrayAsStringDefault); 
This will output: "apple,banana,cherry" 
How can you sort an array of numbers correctly?
You can sort an array of numbers correctly using the .sort() method with a compare function. By default, the .sort() method sorts elements as strings, which can lead to incorrect ordering for numbers. To sort numbers in ascending order, you can provide a compare function that subtracts one number from another. Here is an example:
let numbers = [10, 5, 2, 8, 1];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); 
console.log(numbers); 
This will output: [1, 2, 5, 8, 10]
To sort in descending order, you can reverse the subtraction:
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a); 
console.log(numbers); 
This will output: [10, 8, 5, 2, 1]
Q21. How can you create a copy of an array?
You can create a copy of an array using several methods, including the .slice() method, the spread operator (...), or the Array.from() method. Here are examples of each method:
Using .slice():
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let copiedArray = originalArray.slice(); 
console.log(copiedArray); 
Using the spread operator:
let copiedArraySpread = [...originalArray]; 
console.log(copiedArraySpread); 
Using Array.from():
let copiedArrayFrom = Array.from(originalArray); 
console.log(copiedArrayFrom); 
All of these methods will create a shallow copy of the original array, meaning that if the array contains objects or other arrays, only the references to those objects/arrays are copied, not the actual objects/arrays themselves.
Q22. How can you convert an array into a single string?
You can convert an array into a single string using the .join() method. This method concatenates all elements of the array into a single string, with an optional separator between each element. Here is an example:   
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
let arrayAsString = myArray.join(', '); 
console.log(arrayAsString);     




Q23. How can you remove a specific item from an array by its name or value?
You can remove a specific item from an array by its name or value using the .indexOf() method to find the index of the item and then using the .splice() method to remove it. Here is an example:
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
let itemToRemove = 'banana';
let index = myArray.indexOf(itemToRemove);
if (index !== -1) {
    myArray.splice(index, 1); 
}
console.log(myArray); 
This will output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']
In this example, we first find the index of the item we want to remove using .indexOf(). If the item is found (i.e., the index is not -1), we use .splice() to remove it from the array. The second argument to .splice() specifies how many elements to remove, which is 1 in this case.
Q24. How can you add multiple elements at once to an array?
You can add multiple elements at once to an array using the .push() method or the .concat() method. Here are examples of both methods:
Using .push():
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4, 5, 6); 
console.log(myArray); 
This will output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Using .concat():
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let newElements = [4, 5, 6];
let combinedArray = myArray.concat(newElements); 
console.log(combinedArray); 
This will output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
The .push() method modifies the original array by adding the new elements to the end, while the .concat() method creates a new array that combines the original array with the new elements without modifying the original array.
console.log(myArray); // prints the modified array
Q25. How can you fill an array with the same value?
You can fill an array with the same value using the .fill() method. This method changes all elements in an array to a static value, from a start index (default is 0) to an end index (default is the array's length). Here is an example:
let myArray = new Array(5); // creates an array of length 5
myArray.fill('hello'); 
console.log(myArray); 
This will output: ['hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello']
You can also specify a start and end index to fill only a portion of the array:
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
myArray.fill('hi', 1, 4); 
console.log(myArray); 
This will output: [1, 'hi', 'hi', 'hi', 5]
In this example, the elements from index 1 to index 3 (4 is not included) are filled with the value 'hi'.
Q26. How can you find the first and last positions of an element that repeats?
You can find the first and last positions of an element that repeats in an array using the .indexOf() method to find the first occurrence and the .lastIndexOf() method to find the last occurrence. Here is an example:
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana', 'date'];
let itemToFind = 'banana';
let firstPosition = myArray.indexOf(itemToFind); 
let lastPosition = myArray.lastIndexOf(itemToFind);
console.log('First position: ' + firstPosition); 
console.log('Last position: ' + lastPosition); 
This will output:
First position: 1
Last position: 3
In this example, .indexOf() returns the index of the first occurrence of 'banana', and .lastIndexOf() returns the index of the last occurrence of 'banana' in the array. If the item is not found, both methods will return -1.
Q27. How can you combine all array elements into one string?
Use .join() to display them in one line separated by commas or spaces.
You can combine all array elements into one string using the .join() method. This method concatenates all elements of the array into a single string, with an optional separator between each element. Here is an example:
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
let arrayAsString = myArray.join(', '); 
console.log(arrayAsString); 
This will output: "apple, banana, cherry"       
Q28. Create an array of five numbers.
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in the array using a loop.
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}
console.log("Sum of all numbers: " + sum); 
This will output: Sum of all numbers: 150   
Q29. Explain in your own words what .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() do.
.map() - creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array. It does not modify the original array.
.filter() - creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a specified test (provided as a function). It filters out elements that do not meet the criteria and does not modify the original array.
.reduce() - reduces the array to a single value by applying a provided function (the reducer) to each element of the array, accumulating the result. It processes each element in sequence and returns a single output value. Here are code examples for each method:
Using .map():
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); 
console.log(doubled); 
This will output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]      
Q30. Create an array of ages and use .filter() to find only the ages above 18.
let ages = [15, 22, 18, 30, 16, 25];
let adults = ages.filter(age => age > 18); 
console.log(adults);
Q31. Create an array of prices and use .reduce() to calculate the total sum.
let prices = [10.5, 20.75, 5.99, 15.0];
let totalSum = prices.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0); 
console.log("Total sum of prices: " + totalSum); 
This will output: Total sum of prices: 52.24
Q32. Create an array of strings and use .map() to convert each string to uppercase.
let strings = ['hello', 'world', 'javascript'];
let uppercased = strings.map(str => str.toUpperCase()); 
console.log(uppercased); 
This will output: ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'JAVASCRIPT']
Q33. Create an array of numbers and use .filter() to find only the even numbers.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];  
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); 
console.log(evenNumbers); 
This will output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Q34. How can you test whether all items in an array pass a condition?
You can test whether all items in an array pass a condition
Q35. How can you test whether at least one item in an array passes a condition?
Method	Definition	When to Use	Code Example
.some(callback)	Returns true if at least one element matches	When checking if any value qualifies	let arr=[1,3,5,6]; arr.some(x=>x%2===0); // true
Use .some() and give an example.
Q36. How can you flatten an array that has nested arrays inside it?
Method	Definition	When to Use	Code Example
.flat(depth)	Removes nesting and returns single-level array	When you have arrays inside arrays	let arr=[1,[2,3],[4,[5]]]; arr.flat(1); // [1,2,3,4,[5]]
arr.flat(2); 
Q37. How can you transform all array elements to uppercase or lowercase?
| Method                      | Definition                            | When to Use                 | Code Example                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.map()` + `.toUpperCase()` | Converts each string to **uppercase** | When you want all caps      | `let arr=['hello','world']; arr.map(x=>x.toUpperCase()); // ["HELLO","WORLD"]` |
| `.map()` + `.toLowerCase()` | Converts each string to **lowercase** | When you want all lowercase | `let arr=['Hello','WORLD']; arr.map(x=>x.toLowerCase()); // ["hello","world"]` |
Q38. How can you remove all duplicate values from an array?
Q39. How can you create a copy of an array without changing the original?
const original = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const copy1 = original.slice();
console.log(copy1); 
const copy2 = [...original];
console.log(copy2);
copy2.push(5);
console.log
How can you use .reduce() to find both the total and average of numbers in an array?
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const total = numbers.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);
const average = total / numbers.length;
console.log("Total:", total);     
console.log("Average:", average);
Q41. How can you use .map() and .filter() together to process data?
You can use .map() and .filter() together to first transform the data and then filter it based on a condition. For example, you might want to convert all strings in an array to uppercase and then filter out only those that start with a specific letter. Here is an example:
let strings = ['apple', 'banana', 'avocado', 'cherry', 'apricot'];
let result = strings
    .map(str => str.toUpperCase()) 
    .filter(str => str.startsWith('A'));
     Q42. How can you check if a specific word exists in a list of words, ignoring case sensitivity?

     const words = ["Apple", "banana", "Cherry"];
const searchWord = "BANANA";
const exists = words.some(word => word.toLowerCase() === searchWord.toLowerCase());
console.log(exists);
console.log(copy2); 
This will output: ["APPLE", "AVOCADO", "APRICOT"]
In this example, we first use .map() to convert all strings to uppercase. Then, we use .filter() to keep only those strings that start with the letter 'A'. The result is an array of uppercase strings that meet the specified condition.  
Q43. How can you use .reduce() to turn an array of words into a sentence (a single string)?
let words = ['Hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'JavaScript'];
let sentence = words.reduce((accumulator, currentWord) => accumulator + ' ' + currentWord);
console.log(sentence); 
This will output: "Hello world this is JavaScript"
In this example, we use .reduce() to concatenate all the words in the array into a single string, with a space between each word. The accumulator starts as the first word, and each subsequent word is added to it with a space in between.
